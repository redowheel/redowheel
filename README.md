## About me
I'm a hobbyst programmer. I mostly re-invent the wheel and stuff like this. As future plans, I want to study CS in university.

## Interested in
I'm interested in classical music, reading books (from ebook-readers) and programming.

## About re-inventing the wheel
Re-inventing the wheel is bad - but it's fun!! so I even put this to my nickname. I of course do this for only personal projects.

## BTW
I use NixOS and NeoVim btw!!
